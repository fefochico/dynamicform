This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.

## Description
This project is a small angular project to create a simple list where you can add elements using an dynamic formulary. Why is this form dynamic? Because it is builded from a json file. Where it is defined all properties of formulary. In this project I have used only one external package Bootstrap 3.3.7.
